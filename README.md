# wistia-upload-angular

Built using Yeoman, with [generator-gulp-angular](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular).

* `gulp serve` for development, watches for file changes and deploys to port 3000. Uses live-reload, so no more browser refreshes :)

* `gulp build` packages everything to `dist/`

* `firebase deploy` for deploying
